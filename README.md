# My portfolio

This is a new version of my portfolio based on Next.js 15 and React.js 19. Using SSR to get a better performace in the web.

## Instalation

First you have to clone the repository.

`git clone TODO`

Then you have to install all the necesary dependencies.

`npm install`

And then just the project locally.

`npm run dev`

Those are explanations with `npm` but you can use whatever you want like bun or pnpm.
